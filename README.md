# Social Network Analysis on Global Spread of COVID-19

The main reason for spread of COVID – 19 between countries and distant regions is the flight travels that are undergone by the COVID – 19 affected people. So, it becomes crucial to keep records of the travel details and the social network that is formed by these affected patients, in order to contain and take the required counter actions to prevent the spread of the COVID – 19 virus. Our project helps in simulating a social network and deducing the various centrality measures which would help in keeping proper track records regarding the travel details of COVID – 19 affected patients and also to infer a clear idea on the extent to which each country is responsible for the spread of the COVID – 19.
